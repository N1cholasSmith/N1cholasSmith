If your company would benefit greatly from having a ruthlessly professional leader with a passion for innovative technologies, I am the perfect candidate. I have been recognized publicly with a commendation for performing exceptionally well during my Navy Leadership Promotion Course. I promote a culture that strives for continual development, excellence, leadership, and innovation. I believe these are key defining factors that set a team up for success. Through my leadership, I can motivate and influence members to achieve goals as a collective while promoting team cohesiveness. One of my strongest qualities is my ability to be a logical thinker, which I utilize to troubleshoot problems and issues. I can break them down in a logical manner to solve them effectively and efficiently. 

Through my pursuit of ruthless professionalism, I am intrinsically motivated to continually develop. This attitude is applied in various areas of my life. Most notably, I have developed a solid core base of underpinning knowledge required to be a valued member of any coding team. Although I possess strong leadership attributes, I understand that I must accept my role in the team for a team to operate effectively and efficiently. However, there will be a solid ambition to advance my career. 

Excellence is the cornerstone and expectation I have for all goals I set out to achieve. Through logical thinking to analyze what is required to complete a task and put in that extra 1% with every task so the finished product is exceptional and something to be proud of, this stems back to my continual development and intrinsic motivation. I am very well-spoken as clear, and effective communication is required to lead a team in a high-tempo technical environment which I have been performing highly in for some time.

As I pursue a career change into software engineering, I anticipate my knowledge of Search Engine Optimization and Data Management as an Aircraft Technician will be pivotal in seeing problems and solutions from other perspectives. I bring a very diverse background to the table, making me an invaluable asset to any organization and allowing me to grow exponentially in a professional capacity. I bring motivating enthusiasm to the table and genuinely love seeing improvement and achieving goals. 

As a Software Engineer, I am focused on showcasing my ability and underpinning knowledge to create a product any client would be proud of. With my diverse background, I will put myself in the client's shoes and analyze what is essential to produce the best product. This is why I will be an invaluable member of any company or organization.
